## Hospital Database 

A database that stores data pertaining to a hospital (appointments, patient info, contacts, doctor and staff info, real estate info, etc.) build from the ground up and maintained using the PostgreSQL Data Management System (DMS). Database design and implementation is done using DDL, ER diagram, and Relational Database Schema Diagram (RDSD), and retrieval of data is supported with help of multiple queries, triggers, view implementations, and other DML implementations. Lucid chart was used to design both the ER Diagram and RDSD.
